# oblique-strategies

> Oblique Strategies is a card-based method developed by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help artists overcome creative blocks. Each card in the deck contains a vague or ambiguous phrase which can be used to solve a problem intuitively, by breaking conventional thinking patterns and interpreting it from a new perspective.
